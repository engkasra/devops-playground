## Before you begin 
- You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.
you can create and initialize your cluster with **[kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/)**.
- You need to have a default **[StorageClass](https://github.com/engkasra/Arvan/blob/main/Concepts/Storage%20class.md)**, or **[statically provision PersistentVolumes](https://github.com/engkasra/Arvan/blob/main/Concepts/statically%20provision%20PersistentVolumes.md)** yourself to satisfy the **[PersistentVolumeClaims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims)** used here.
- This tutorial assumes you are familiar with PersistentVolumes and StatefulSets, as well as other core concepts like Pods, Services, and ConfigMaps.

## Objectives
- Deploy a replicated MySQL topology with a StatefulSet.
- Send MySQL client traffic.
- Observe resistance to downtime.
- Scale the StatefulSet up and down.
## Deploy MySQL
The example MySQL deployment consists of a ConfigMap, two Services, and a StatefulSet.
### Create a ConfigMap
Create the ConfigMap from the following YAML configuration file:
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mysql
  labels:
    app: mysql
    app.kubernetes.io/name: mysql
data:
  primary.cnf: |
    # Apply this config only on the primary.
    [mysqld]
    log-bin    
  replica.cnf: |
    # Apply this config only on replicas.
    [mysqld]
    super-read-only    
```
This ConfigMap provides `my.cnf` overrides that let you independently control configuration on the primary MySQL server and its replicas. In this case, you want the primary server to be able to serve replication logs to replicas and you want replicas to reject any writes that don't come via replication.

There's nothing special about the ConfigMap itself that causes different portions to apply to different Pods. Each Pod decides which portion to look at as it's initializing, based on information provided by the StatefulSet controller.

### Create Services
Create the Services from the following YAML configuration file:
```yml
# Headless service for stable DNS entries of StatefulSet members.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
  labels:
    app: mysql
    app.kubernetes.io/name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - name: mysql
    port: 3306
  clusterIP: None
  selector:
    app: mysql
---
# Client service for connecting to any MySQL instance for reads.
# For writes, you must instead connect to the primary: mysql-0.mysql.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-read
  labels:
    app: mysql
    app.kubernetes.io/name: mysql
    readonly: "true"
spec:
  ports:
  - name: mysql
    port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
```
### Create the StatefulSet
Finally, create the StatefulSet from the following YAML configuration file:
```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
      app.kubernetes.io/name: mysql
  serviceName: mysql
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
        app.kubernetes.io/name: mysql
    spec:
      initContainers:
      - name: init-mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        command:
        - bash
        - "-c"
        - |
          set -ex
          # Generate mysql server-id from pod ordinal index.
          [[ $HOSTNAME =~ -([0-9]+)$ ]] || exit 1
          ordinal=${BASH_REMATCH[1]}
          echo [mysqld] > /mnt/conf.d/server-id.cnf
          # Add an offset to avoid reserved server-id=0 value.
          echo server-id=$((100 + $ordinal)) >> /mnt/conf.d/server-id.cnf
          # Copy appropriate conf.d files from config-map to emptyDir.
          if [[ $ordinal -eq 0 ]]; then
            cp /mnt/config-map/primary.cnf /mnt/conf.d/
          else
            cp /mnt/config-map/replica.cnf /mnt/conf.d/
          fi          
        volumeMounts:

## Understanding stateful Pod initialization
The StatefulSet controller starts Pods one at a time, in order by their ordinal index. It waits until each Pod reports being Ready before starting the next one.

In addition, the controller assigns each Pod a unique, stable name of the form `<statefulset-name>-<ordinal-index>`, which results in Pods named `mysql-0`, `mysql-1`, and `mysql-2`.

The Pod template in the above StatefulSet manifest takes advantage of these properties to perform orderly startup of MySQL replication.

### Generating configuration
Before starting any of the containers in the Pod spec, the Pod first runs any init containers in the order defined.

The first init container, named `init-mysql`, generates special MySQL config files based on the ordinal index.

The script determines its own ordinal index by extracting it from the end of the Pod name, which is returned by the `hostname` command. Then it saves the ordinal (with a numeric offset to avoid reserved values) into a file called `server-id.cnf` in the MySQL `conf.d` directory. This translates the unique, stable identity provided by the StatefulSet into the domain of MySQL server IDs, which require the same properties.

The script in the `init-mysql` container also applies either `primary.cnf` or `replica.cnf` from the ConfigMap by copying the contents into `conf.d.` Because the example topology consists of a single primary MySQL server and any number of replicas, the script assigns ordinal `0` to be the primary server, and everyone else to be replicas. Combined with the StatefulSet controller's deployment order guarantee, this ensures the primary MySQL server is Ready before creating replicas, so they can begin replicating.

### Cloning existing data
In general, when a new Pod joins the set as a replica, it must assume the primary MySQL server might already have data on it. It also must assume that the replication logs might not go all the way back to the beginning of time. These conservative assumptions are the key to allow a running StatefulSet to scale up and down over time, rather than being fixed at its initial size.

The second init container, named `clone-mysql`, performs a clone operation on a replica Pod the first time it starts up on an empty PersistentVolume. That means it copies all existing data from another running Pod, so its local state is consistent enough to begin replicating from the primary server.

MySQL itself does not provide a mechanism to do this, so the example uses a popular open-source tool called Percona XtraBackup. During the clone, the source MySQL server might suffer reduced performance. To minimize impact on the primary MySQL server, the script instructs each Pod to clone from the Pod whose ordinal index is one lower. This works because the StatefulSet controller always ensures Pod `N` is Ready before starting Pod `N+1`.

### Starting replication
After the init containers complete successfully, the regular containers run. The MySQL Pods consist of a `mysql` container that runs the actual `mysqld` server, and an `xtrabackup` container that acts as a sidecar.

The `xtrabackup` sidecar looks at the cloned data files and determines if it's necessary to initialize MySQL replication on the replica. If so, it waits for `mysqld` to be ready and then executes the `CHANGE MASTER TO` and `START SLAVE` commands with replication parameters extracted from the XtraBackup clone files.

Once a replica begins replication, it remembers its primary MySQL server and reconnects automatically if the server restarts or the connection dies. Also, because replicas look for the primary server at its stable DNS name (`mysql-0.mysql`), they automatically find the primary server even if it gets a new Pod IP due to being rescheduled.

Lastly, after starting replication, the `xtrabackup` container listens for connections from other Pods requesting a data clone. This server remains up indefinitely in case the StatefulSet scales up, or in case the next Pod loses its PersistentVolumeClaim and needs to redo the clone.
